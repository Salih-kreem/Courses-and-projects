[1] Export:-
    It means if you put the variable or function or component
    In export mode, this means using it in another files
    But it can't be used unless it is in import mode.

    Syntax:
     export let varName = "Value";

     Example:
     
     export let yourName = 'Salih';

[2] Import:-
    It means importing a variable or component from a specific file 
    But a variable cannot be imported unless it is in export mode.

    Syntax:

    import varName from 'path';

    Example:

    import {yourName} from './index'

    Note: In path don't write extensions 

[3] Export Default:
    It means that it cannot be repeated and used only once

    Syntax:
    
    export default varName or functionName;

    Note: If it is a function, don't write parentheses. 

[4] The difference between Export & Export Default:-

    1- Export:
       - It can repeated
       - It's imported in brackets

    2- Export Default:
       - It cannot repeated
       - It's imported without brackets
